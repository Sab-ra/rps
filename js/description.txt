--Preparation-- 

JS reads functions: 
  sample( array ) -- takes an array as the argument and returns a random index value as a string
  countRounds -- takes an number as an initial count of rounds and returns a number greater by 1
    input: integer
  countShoots
  getComputerChoice
  assignPiecesValue
  evaluateShootPowerOfPlayerChoice
  shootResult
  win
  lose
  tie
  lousyChoice
  playRound
  shoot

And then initialises global variables

--Action--

  1. Say hi to player with constant Greetings.

  2. Ask the player how many rounds they want to play.

  3. Assign score as 0-0, and give it to player

  4. Values of the pieces( r, p, s ) depend on computer choices. Initially it's 0.0.0

  5. Declare a round number to the player
    countRounds( initialCount ) 
      input roundCounter : int
      output roundCounter : int
    Function assigns +1 to the previous round counter.

  6. shoot
